## What is it?

It is your go to desktop application for measuring code quality.

WTFpm allows you to measure amount of WTF that you have experienced while reading someones code.

## How to use it?

When you launch the application you will see simple interface that was designed to help you measure WTF.
Window itself always stays on top, after you press the "Start" button in the top right corner, application will start measuring your WTF.

We are currently working on Computer Vision extension that will automatically detect your WTF while monitoring your facial expression through webcam.

In the meantime, we strongly suggest to use "WTF?!" button instead.

It is important to be careful with "Reset" button, as it will stop the timer and erase all the WTF that have been recorded.
